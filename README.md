# RunHold

RunHold is a small Windows 11 tray utility for games and simple personal automation tasks. It captures the keyboard keys you are physically holding when you activate it, keeps those keys held with synthetic input, and releases them when you stop.

## 1.0 Scope

- Keyboard hold only.
- Target: stable hold for up to three captured keyboard keys.
- A single keyboard or supported mouse-button toggle activates and stops a hold.
- No macro recording or playback in 1.0.
- Dark and light UI themes.
- Launches minimized to the tray by default, start with Windows is optional.

## Build

Install the .NET 10 Desktop SDK, then run:

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet run --project src/RunHold
```

## Security Position

RunHold monitors keyboard state and supported mouse trigger buttons, and it injects keyboard input, so it is treated as security-sensitive. It does not include networking, telemetry, credential capture, macro recording, or raw typed-text logging.
