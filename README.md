# KeyHold

KeyHold is a small Windows 11 tray utility for single-player games. It captures the keyboard keys you are physically holding when you activate it, keeps those keys held with synthetic input, and releases them when you stop.

The working product names are KeyHold and KeyRun. The current implementation uses KeyHold in code while the brand work compares KeyLatch, KeyRun, and PressLatch.

## Beta Scope

- Keyboard hold only.
- Keyboard or mouse buttons can activate and stop a hold.
- No macro recording or playback in 1.0.
- No stealth behavior, multiplayer advantage, anti-cheat bypassing, or hidden automation.
- Dark and light UI themes.
- Launches minimized to the tray by default.

## Initial Game Matrix

- Satisfactory on Steam
- The Planet Crafter on Steam
- Far Cry 6 on Epic

## Build

Install the .NET 10 Desktop SDK, then run:

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet run --project src/KeyHold
```

## Security Position

KeyHold monitors keyboard state and injects keyboard input, so it is treated as security-sensitive. It does not include networking, telemetry, credential capture, macro recording, or raw typed-text logging.
