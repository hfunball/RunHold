# Store And GitHub Listing Notes

RunHold should be easy to find for people searching for a small Windows utility that can hold movement keys, run keys, or simple keyboard combinations.

Keep the copy plain. Avoid promising compatibility with every game or app.

## Short Description

RunHold is a Windows tray utility that keeps selected keyboard keys held until you stop it.

## Longer Description

RunHold helps with games and simple personal Windows tasks where holding movement keys gets repetitive. Hold the keys you want RunHold to take over, press your toggle trigger, and release the physical keys. RunHold keeps those keys held until you stop the hold or take control back from the keyboard.

RunHold is intended for individual Windows PCs. It does not record macros, play back scripts, collect telemetry, upload data, or try to bypass anti-cheat tools.

## Update Messaging

- Microsoft Store installs receive updates through the Microsoft Store.
- GitHub portable ZIP installs update manually by downloading a newer ZIP and replacing the app folder.
- Do not describe a built-in RunHold updater for 1.2.
- Do not mention `.appinstaller` in public copy until a direct-download MSIX path exists.
